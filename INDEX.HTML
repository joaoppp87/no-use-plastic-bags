                <p>Join us in the fight against plastic straws and bags! We are committed to preserving our planet and protecting the environment for future generations. Plastic straws and bags are just a small part of the problem, but we can make a big difference by eliminating them from our lives.

                    Why do we care about straws and plastic bags? Because they pose a significant threat to our oceans, wildlife and human health. Millions of tons of plastic are discarded annually, often finding their way into our oceans, where they harm marine animals and pollute our beaches.
                    
                    By refusing to use plastic straws and bags, we can reduce our plastic footprint and help protect marine life. Opting for reusable alternatives, such as metal, bamboo or glass straws, and reusable fabric bags, is a simple but powerful way to do your part.
                    
                    Join us in this campaign to create a cleaner, more sustainable future. Make the change today and say no to straws and plastic bags. Together we can make the difference!"
                    
                    Join our campaign and help us spread awareness about the harm caused by plastic straws and bags. The future of our planet is in our hands. Let's act now to protect what is ours.</p>

            <p>Campaign Against the Use of Straws and Plastic Bags by the Seventh Year Koala at Ensiduc School. Hello everybody, It is with great enthusiasm that the seventh year Koala at Ensiduc School launches its campaign against the use of straws and plastic bags. Our goal is to raise awareness in our school community about the harmful impacts of these disposable items on the environment and encourage more sustainable practices. How does our campaign work?</p>
 <p>1. Education and Awareness: We started our campaign with educational activities in the classroom, where we discussed the damage caused by plastic to the environment and marine species. We use visual resources, videos and lectures to illustrate the harmful effects of plastic and highlight the importance of changing habits.</p>
<p> 2. Commitment and Engagement: We invite all students and staff to commit to reducing the use of straws and plastic bags in their daily routines. Through posters, banners and written pledges, we demonstrate our commitment to the cause and encourage others to join us on this journey.</p>       
<p>3. Sustainable Alternatives: We present sustainable alternatives to straws and plastic bags, such as metal, bamboo or paper straws, and reusable fabric bags. We promote these alternatives through practical demonstrations and sample distribution, encouraging people to adopt these options in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>4. Events and Activities: We organize a series of events and activities to involve the entire school community. We carry out cleaning campaigns in areas close to the school, reusable bag making workshops and sustainable art competitions, among other activities, to inspire action and promote awareness.</p>
<p> 5. Support and Partnerships: We seek the support of local businesses and environmental organizations to expand the impact of our campaign. We established partnerships with supermarkets to promote the use of reusable bags and received donations of sustainable materials to distribute among campaign participants.</p>
<p>6. Evaluation and Continuity: We regularly evaluate the progress of our campaign and seek feedback from the school community to identify areas for improvement. We are committed to keeping our campaign on track and finding new ways to promote more sustainable habits at our school and beyond.</p>
<P>Together, we are making a difference. Join us on this important journey towards a cleaner and more sustainable future! Yours sincerely, The Seventh Year Koala at Ensiduc School
